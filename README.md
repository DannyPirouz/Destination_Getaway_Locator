# Destination Getaway Locator

A few of my friends are pilots and they say all they want to do is to go somewhere hot during their few days off. 
So I created this project which is a web application made more for pilots or first officers who have a few days off before their next flight and want to go somewhere hot. 
They can enter a specific temperature and a list of popular vacation cities like Cancun or Honolulu will appear. With their flight pass benefits, trips will be very affordable.
Users can also click on the cities where they will be redirected to a website that displays the crime rate for that city.

To run the application:
1. You need to get an API key from openweathermap.org and paste your key in apiKey
2. run npm install
3. run npm install axios
4. run npm install express
5. run npm install node-fetch
6. run the server by running node server.js
